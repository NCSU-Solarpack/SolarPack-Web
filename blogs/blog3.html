      <p>Sean welding the pedal onto the chassis<br>The Vehicle Dynamics team is currently engaged in developing various structural components for the car’s chassis. A current focus is on welding pedal mounts that will secure the acceleration and brake pedals. Sean, Solarpack’s technical director, is leading the effort to ensure the welding process is secure.</p>
      
      <p>Jake and Alex practicing welding<br>Two of the team’s newest members, Jake and Alex, are gaining hands-on experience as they learn to weld. They have begun practicing on scrap metal to refine their skills, preparing for more complex tasks in the future. Additionally, Nathan has been working on an innovative mounting device called the iBooster which is designed to assist in increased brake efficiency. This advancement is expected to help the vehicle's performance with a more responsive braking.</p>
      
      <p>Nathan using the drill press to create the mount for the iBooster<br>Looking forward, the team plans to install a dash bar in the middle of the chassis. This will house various dashboard components, including the speedometer, gauges, and potentially a touchscreen display screen. These enhancements give the driver essential information while improving the driving experience. As the Vehicle Dynamics team collaborates on these projects, they are not only building an efficiency focused and environmentally friendly vehicle but also fostering a culture of learning and innovation within Solarpack.</p>
