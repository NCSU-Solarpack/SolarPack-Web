      <p>The stacked batteries<br>The High Voltage team has worked on getting the batteries ready for all of Fenrir’s different systems. Although their primary focus was on the batteries, the team also worked on the motors for the brakes and accelerators, along with the coding for the thermistor (a device that checks temperature).</p>
      <p>On October 10, the batteries were connected and labeled numerically with the help of coated copper cables. On the lower end of the battery pack, two batteries were placed next to each other oppositely, with one battery’s positive end being next to the other. The next two batteries were positioned similarly, except this time stacked on top of the lower batteries. This was done so that all 4 batteries could be connected, with one battery’s positive end being connected to the other’s negative end.</p>

      <p>Copper cables being attached at each end</p>
      <p>The batteries were attached one at a time using copper cables and screws which were manually put on. Each time two batteries were connected, a Voltmeter was connected to the copper plating, to measure the voltage of the battery. This process was repeated 3 more times, to ensure that the required voltage for the batteries combined reached 400V,  and luckily the voltage did almost approximately reach that amount. This was important because, through calculations, the team determined that 400V was the amount required for the car. Although the batteries worked, the team noted that while the cables worked temporarily for the test, they needed to be more flexible in the future.</p>
