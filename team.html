			<div class="member-card">
				<img src="assets/images/headshots/fabiola_plascencia.jpg" alt="Fabiola Fabian Plascencia" class="member-img" />
				<div class="member-name">Fabiola Fabian Plascencia</div>
				<div class="member-role">Project Director</div>
				<p style="color:var(--subtxt);font-size:0.98rem;margin-bottom:0.7rem;">As project director, I manage SolarPack’s administration, coordinate collaboration between teams, and keep us true to our core mission of practical sustainability. I joined SolarPack because I want to use my mechanical engineering degree to contribute to the creation and implementation of sustainable practices. The engineers I admire the most are those who carefully consider how their designs will impact people in unexpected ways, both in the present and in the future. In my free time, I enjoy listening to musicals, playing video games, and watching Disney movies.</p>

			<div class="member-card">
				<img src="assets/images/headshots/will_shearin.jpg" alt="Will Shearin" class="member-img" />
				<div class="member-name">Will Shearin</div>
				<div class="member-role">Technical Director</div>
				<p style="color:var(--subtxt);font-size:0.98rem;margin-bottom:0.7rem;">As Technical Director, I manage a team of students whose responsibility is to model, test, and fabricate the chassis, roll cage, and other mechanical structures of the car, while also coordinating efforts across all engineering teams. I am currently a senior in mechanical engineering, and I joined SolarPack right after my sophomore year. I took over as Technical Director after my junior year and have really enjoyed all my time here. I can see how my classroom skills translate into real-world environments, and how I can contribute to promoting sustainability. In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with friends and cooking.</p>

			<div class="member-card">
				<img src="assets/images/headshots/maghen_lahoud.jpg" alt="Maghen Lahoud" class="member-img" />
				<div class="member-name">Maghen Lahoud</div>
				<div class="member-role">Aerodynamics Lead</div>
				<p style="color:var(--subtxt);font-size:0.98rem;margin-bottom:0.7rem;">As the aero team lead, I oversee the development of the aeroshell through 3D modeling and composite manufacturing. I joined SolarPack as a freshman because it aligns with my goal of eventually working in aerospace sustainability. Now, as a sophomore, I feel I've gained valuable technical and interpersonal skills while on the team. Outside of SolarPack, I enjoy hiking, swimming, traveling, trying new foods, and collecting rocks.</p>

				<div class="member-name">Nathan Hambleton</div>
				<div class="member-role">High Voltage Lead</div>
				<p style="color:var(--subtxt);font-size:0.98rem;margin-bottom:0.7rem;">As High Voltage Lead, I’m responsible for the car’s main power and propulsion systems—the 3‑phase motor, inverter, battery pack, and protection systems. I will also jump in on low‑voltage, building firmware, controls, and interfaces, and I help out with our website and app code when needed.</p>

			<div class="member-card">
				<img src="assets/images/headshots/default.jpg" alt="Low Voltage Lead" class="member-img" />
				<div class="member-name">Matt Pugliese</div>
				<div class="member-role">Low Voltage Lead</div>
				<p style="color:var(--subtxt);font-size:0.98rem;margin-bottom:0.7rem;"></p>

			<div class="member-card">
				<img src="assets/images/headshots/max_weiser.jpg" alt="Max Weiser" class="member-img" />
				<div class="member-name">Max Weiser</div>
				<div class="member-role">System Architecture Lead</div>
				<p style="color:var(--subtxt);font-size:0.98rem;margin-bottom:0.7rem;">As the Systems Architecture lead, I lead the development of communication and telemetry systems in the car. I joined SolarPack during the first semester of my freshman year because I was fascinated with the concept of making an electric car fun to drive. During my time with SolarPack, I have learned many skills and gained experiences that I would have never received in my classes. For example, I am now capable of designing and building PCBs, operating HAM radio, and so much more. During my free time, I enjoy playing video games, watching anime, and cooking.</p>

				<div class="member-role">Vehicle Dynamics Lead</div>
				<p style="color:var(--subtxt);font-size:0.98rem;margin-bottom:0.7rem;">As the vehicle dynamics team lead, I oversee the development of mechanical aspects within the car, involving systems such as suspension, steering, and powertrain. My interest in these systems stemmed from my interest in LEGO as a child. My other hobbies include playing guitar, playing videogames, and skateboarding.</p>

I am a sophomore majoring in Business Administration with a concentration in Finance. Originally, I was going to major in Mechanical Engineering given my interest in cars and combustion engines. I enjoy playing games, food, and learning to cook foods.</p>
